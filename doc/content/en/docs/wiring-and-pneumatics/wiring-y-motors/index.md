  Routing and connecting the Y motor cables 
---

The left and right Y motors are connected to the motherboard using the cable harnesses CHA-0001 and CHA-0002, respectively. Grab these from your bundle of cables.

Start by plugging in the **unlabeled** end of the cables into the Y motors. CHA-0001 goes to Y1 (the left Y motor), and CHA-0002 goes to Y2 (the right Y motor). Use four zip ties to secure the wires in place using the channels in the back legs as shown below.

Next, put your LumenPnP up on its haunches, and route the cables along the inside groove of the extrusion running towards the front of the machine. Use the cable clips to hold the cables in place.

Once the cables have been routed to the underside of the staging plate, use a cable clamp, M3x14mm bolt, and M3 nut to hold the cables as shown in the image below.

Route the cables underneath the motherboard for now; we'll plug them in in a later step!
