  Connecting and securing the Y gantry umbilical cable 
---

For this, all you'll need is your freshly made Y gantry umbilical cable, and your bag of zip ties.

## Securing to the Y gantry

To begin, plug in the four terminal connector with only three wires into the limit switch on the left side of the Y gantry. Plug in the other connector (six terminal connector with only four wires) into the X gantry stepper motor, also on the left side of the Y gantry.

Now, we need to zip tie the harness to the cable guide on the Y gantry. Align the harness as shown in the picture below, and secure the cable to the Y gantry umbilical mount with three big zip ties.

## Securing to the frame

Now we need to secure the other end of the umbilical to the frame of the machine, on the front left leg. Move the Y gantry all the way to the back of the machine until you feel it hit the limit of travel. This will ensure that you don't fasten the cable too tightly such that it restricts the machine's motion.

Now, take the umbilical and guide it along the curved recess in the frame umbilical mount. Take two zip ties and **loosely** secure them through the zip tie guides and around the umbilical. Do not tighten them yet, as we still need to route the X gantry umbilical through this same pair of zip ties.
