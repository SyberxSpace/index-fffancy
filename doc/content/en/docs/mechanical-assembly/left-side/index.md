  Assembling the left side of the machine
---

Alright, time to get into the build! First, we're going to build up the left side of the machine.

## Belt Tension Arm

{{< container-image path="images/IMG_20210826_150501-web.jpg" alt="Belt Tension Arm Parts" >}}

1. Insert an M3 Hex Nut into the back of a Belt Tension Arm (FDM-0037).

2. Insert the M3x16mm Machine Screw through the front hole in the Belt Tension Arm and then tighten.
3. Thread an M3 Cap Nut on the end of the M3x16mm Machine Screw.

4. Insert the M5x25mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top of the Belt Tension Arm so that it passes through a GT2 Pulley Idler.
5. Add an M5 Nyloc Hex Nut on the bottom of the Belt Tension Arm and tighten. Make sure the idler can still spin freely.

6. Insert the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut into the recess for a hex nut on the bottom of one of the idler mount arms on the Front Left Leg (FDM-0001).
7. Insert completed Belt Tension Arm assembly between the arms on the front leg, with the screw head of the M5x25mm facing up.
8. Insert the M5x40mm Machine Screw through the hole in the top so that it passes through the Belt Tension Arm and tighten into the M5 Nyloc Hex Nut. Do not overtighten, and ensure you can still pivot the tension arm.

## Assembly

9. Take the Back Left Leg (FDM-0003) and insert the v-slot extrusions into the two square holes designed to take this part. Ensure that the extrusion comes to the end of the holes in which they're inserted. If you have a hard time getting the extrusion into the slots, gently slide them into place using some taps from a mallet.

10. Take the front left leg and place it onto two v-slot extrusions at the end opposite the back leg. Your progress should look like the image below.

11. On the top rail, drop in and position a slot nut underneath the hole in the top of each leg and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into the nut.

12. On the bottom rail, the outer side (shown above) has three exposed holes for machine screws (one on the back leg, two on the front leg). For each, drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

13. On the bottom rail, the inner side has one exposed hole for a machine screw on the back leg. Drop in and position a slot nut under it and screw a M5x10mm machine screw into it.

14. Next, attach the GT2 Timing Pulley to the spindle of a NEMA17 stepper motor. Tighten one of the grub screws on the pulley into the flat spot on the spindle. Then mount the NEMA17 stepper motor to the back left leg. Attach it using four M3x8mm screws, ensuring that the connector is facing inwards towards the zip tie loops as dictated in the picture.

15. Mount one of the three limit switches to the front left leg as shown in the image. Use two M3x8mm screws and tap them directly into the print.

16. Next, we'll mount the Frame Umbilical Mount (FDM-0007). Using two M5x25mm screws, attach it to the front left leg as shown, threading directly into the part.

17. Lastly, we'll assemble the umbilical swivel. This part helps keep the X gantry umbilical suspended over the build area. The two parts fit together as shown below, and are secured in place with a M5x40mm bolt and an M5 nut. Tighten so there's no play in the fit, but the two parts can swivel easily. Set it aside for now.
