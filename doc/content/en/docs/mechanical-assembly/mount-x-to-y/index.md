  Attaching the X gantry to the Y gantry

Now that we have both gantries assembled, it's time to put them together.

1. First, fit the X gantry on top of the Y gantry rail. Make sure the X motor is on the left side with the front of the X gantry facing you. 

{{< alert color="warning" title="Note" >}}
You'll find that it's hard to fit the X gantry onto the rail. This is because of a few protrusions on the back plate that hold the belt at the right distance. Loosening the M5x40mm bolts holding the two halves of the X gantry together will help it slot onto the rail.

2. Next, with the top roller bolts still loose, we'll start adding the second set of rollers on the X gantry that hold it onto the rail. Begin by sliding the X gantry tension bars onto the bottom of the X gantry prints. Slide two rollers in between them, ensuring that the holes in them line up with the holes in the X gantry tension bars.

3. Now we can secure these in place using a couple M5x40mm bolts. Pass them through the holes, and loosely tighten them into two M5 nuts in the slots on the back side of the X gantry. Don't tighten all the way yet; we still have some adjustment to do first. You can, however, tighten the **top** roller bolts now that everything is in its place.

4. Now we add tension screws. These are what hold the X gantry tension bars in the correct position to have proper tension along the rail. Take four M3x30mm screws and pass them through the holes in the tension bars, and thread into the M3 nuts inserted into the front and back panels of the X gantry, as shown below. Make sure each screw is tightened the same amount, and that the X gantry can still move freely, but doesn't have any wiggle on the rail. Then tighten the M5x40mm bolts that run through the bottom set of rollers so that their position is locked.

5. Lastly, we'll mount the top camera and ring light. First we'll make the camera subassembly, then mount it to the gantry. Begin by placing the ring light facing downwards into the down light mount. Before we mount the camera into this, we need to loosen the screw holding the lens in place. We'll need to adjust the focal length after the camera is mounted, so we need to loosen it while we can. Unscrew it just enough such that you can turn the lens in and out. You might need a light grip with pliers to get it to make a full turn; this is ok. After you've loosened the lens, place the down camera mount on top, ensuring that the tab from the down light mount fits into the recess. These two prints will pinch the top ring light in place. Lastly, fit the top camera into the down camera mount. Make sure the connector on the back side of the camera is between the two arms of the down camera mount.

There's a piece of black electrical tape on the back of the camera PCB. Don't remove it; it is there to help isolate the camera sensor from light shining through vias in the PCB.

6. Secure the whole stack in place with four M2.5x20mm screws. Tighten them down so that all parts are tightly held together, but don't overtorque; these screws are threading into the plastic of a print.

7. Mount the top camera and light subassembly onto the back of the X gantry using two M3x14mm screws.
