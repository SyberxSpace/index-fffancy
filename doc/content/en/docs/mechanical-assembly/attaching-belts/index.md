  Attaching and tensioning belts for the X and Y gantries
---

With a complete frame assembled, we can now route the GT2 timing belt that makes everything move!

1. We'll start with the Y axis. If you'd like to precut your belt instead of routing the entirety of it through the machine, you can cut two 1400mm lengths for the Y axis motors. To help guide the belth through the openings in the prints, bend it backwards as shown below so that the belt has a curve to it.

2. Take your length of GT2 belt and stick it inside the extrusion (smooth side facing outward), behind the Y gantry as shown below. Take an allen wrench or similar tool and guide the belt through the opening on the side closest to the front of the machine. Once you have it pulled through, loosen the bolts holding the belt clamp onto the Y gantry, and slide it underneath the belt clamp you mounted in an earlier step. Tighten it down with the GT2 belt flush with the edge of the Y gantry.

3. Now, take the other end of your belt and feed it through the front leg. Guide it through and around the idler wheel in the tensioning arm, and feed it back through the other side of the leg as shown below.

4. Feed the other end of your belt behind the Y gantry support print, and all the way through the back leg. Loop it around the GT2 pulley on the stepper motor, and feed it through the other side of the leg.

5. Finally, take the end of the belt and feed it through the other opening of the Y gantry, like we did in step 1. Feed the end between the Y gantry and the belt clamp. Make sure the belt tensioner on the front leg is completely unscrewed, meaning it's angled as close to the leg as it can be. This will give us the most possible stroke to tension the belt in the next step.

6. Pull on the belt with one hand, while holding the Y gantry steady with the other. Getting it generally taught is preferable, but don't worry about getting it perfect; we'll tension it correctly next. Push down on the belt clamp to hold the belt in place, and tighten the two bolts to clamp it down. Cut the belt with at least 20mm remaining out the back side of the Y gantry.

7. Now we can tension the belt. Slowly tighten in the M3 screw on the belt tensioner to increase the belt tension. Pulling back on the belt tensioner arm should be difficult, but possible. A tug should result in only a 2mm deflection. 

8. Perform the same steps on the other side of the machine.

9. We're going to do the exact same operation for the X axis, but with one small thing to keep in mind. When looking at the back of the machine, start by clamping the belt on the **right** side of the X gantry (the side closest to the motor). This way, the excess belt will be sticking out of the X gantry on the side opposite of the limit switch, and prevent a problem with homing. You can precut a 1500mm strip of belt for the X axis.
